Score every tactic against these. They are measured, not aspirational.

- Shopify revenue ~$875/mo. Amazon ~$1,800/mo. Combined ~$2,700/mo.
- AOV $50.46 (trailing 90 days).
- Repeat rate 18-22.5%; repeat customers are ~45-52% of revenue.
  **Retention is the binding constraint, not traffic.**
- 12 SKUs. Natural deodorant, body care, oral care, lip balm.
- Solo operator. No team, no agency, no media buyer, no designer.
- Paid spend is gated behind a hard sequence: Tracking -> CRO -> Offer/AOV -> Traffic.
  A tactic that assumes working attribution or meaningful ad budget is premature.
- Prime directive is revenue, not rankings or traffic.

## Reject a tactic outright when it

- Requires staff, an agency, or a media buyer.
- Requires ad budget materially above current spend.
- Targets a platform Real Skin Care is not on.
- Is motivational framing with no stated mechanism — not actionable, not testable.
- Restates something an existing skill already covers (duplication degrades skill triggering).
- Depends on scale that does not exist here: a large list, high traffic, thousands of reviews.

## Staleness is not uniform

| Tactic class | Decay | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Platform mechanics | Fast — treat anything older than ~18 months with suspicion | Ad account structure, algorithm behavior, placement names, attribution windows |
| Durable principle | Slow — age is nearly irrelevant | Offer construction, positioning, retention psychology, pricing logic |

A 2022 Meta campaign structure describes a system that no longer exists. A 2019 offer
principle is fine. When age is what drove a score down, \`rscFit.reasoning\` MUST name
which class the tactic falls into.`;
